> “... the wisdom of expending public and private funds on education is not to be measured by its direct fruits alone. It will be profitable as a mere investment, to give the masses of people much greater opportunities than they can generally avail themselves of. For by this means many, who would have died unknown, are enabled to get the start needed for bringing out their latent abilities”.
>*-Alfred Marshall*

Education gives one better social standing and pride apart from higher earning capacity. Enables one to better choices in life.
